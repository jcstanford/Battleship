## Battleship

An old board game that has since been made into a virtual chess match.
My version is simple and does not have anything fancy yet.
It is played on one's computer terminal, and has only one ship to sink.

I first build a version of this using Javascript with the aid of the "Head First Javascript Programming" book.
