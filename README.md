### Battleship

My version is simple and does not have anything fancy.
It is played in one's computer terminal, and has only one ship to sink.

My first build of this game was using Javascript with the aid of the "Head First Javascript Programming" book.
When I started learning .Net and the C# language, I tried to replicate that game. It turned out pretty well, 
but I took out the part where the game records your battle statistics.
